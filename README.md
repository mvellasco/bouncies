<h1> Bouncy Numbers </h1>

<p>This is a solution to the following challange:</p>

<p><i>"Working from left-to-right if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its left it is called an increasing number;
for example, 134468. Similarly if no digit is exceeded by the digit to its right it is called a decreasing number;
for example, 66420.
We shall call a positive integer that is neither increasing nor decreasing a "bouncy" number;
for example, 155349. Clearly there cannot be any bouncy numbers below one-hundred, but just
over half of the numbers below one-thousand (525) are bouncy. In fact, the least number for which the
proportion of bouncy numbers first reaches 50% is 538.
Surprisingly, bouncy numbers become more and more common and by the time we reach 21780 the
proportion of bouncy numbers is equal to 90%.
Find the least number for which the proportion of bouncy numbers is exactly 99%."</i></p>

<h3> Requirements </h3>
<p> This solution uses only packages from the python standard library, and works with any version of Python3 above 3.4 </p>

<h3> Running the Solution </h3>
<p> To run the solution, just clone the repository, access the bouncies folder, and type "python3 -m bouncy_numbers"</p>

<h3> Running the tests </h3>
<p> On the main folder(bouncies) type "python3 -m unittest -v" and press enter. All tests should be passing. </p>
